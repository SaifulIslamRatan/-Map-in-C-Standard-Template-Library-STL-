Maps are associative containers that store elements formed by a combination of a key value and a mapped value, following a specific order.A C++ map is a way to store a key-value pair. A map can be declared as follows: #include &lt;iostream> #include &lt;map> map&lt;int, int> sample_map; Each map entry consists of a pair: a key and a value.
